Credit Card Fraud Detection: A Machine Learning Approach

Business Problem Overview
Credit card fraud is a pervasive concern for both financial institutions and cardholders. Fraudsters employ various tactics to steal card information and make unauthorized purchases. Early and accurate detection of fraudulent transactions is crucial for mitigating financial losses and protecting customer trust. Traditional methods often rely on manual review or rule-based systems, which can be:

Inefficient: Manual review is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Error-Prone: Rule-based systems may miss emerging fraud patterns. Inflexible: Adapting to evolving fraud tactics requires constant rule updates. This project proposes a machine learning-based approach to develop a robust model capable of classifying credit card transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. The model leverages historical data to learn patterns associated with fraudulent activities, enabling:

Reduced Financial Losses: Identify and prevent unauthorized transactions before completion. Enhanced Customer Protection: Safeguard cardholders from unauthorized charges and potential identity theft. Improved Operational Efficiency: Automate fraud detection, streamlining workflows and reducing reliance on manual review. 2. Understanding and Defining Fraud

Credit card fraud encompasses various unauthorized activities involving stolen or compromised cards:

Card-Not-Present (CNP) Fraud: Transactions where the card is not physically present, such as online purchases or phone orders. Counterfeit Fraud: Fraudsters create fake or cloned cards using stolen information to make unauthorized purchases. Lost/Stolen Card Fraud: When a lost or stolen card is used by unauthorized individuals for purchases. Account Takeover (ATO) Fraud: Fraudsters gain access to a cardholder's account information (login credentials) to make unauthorized transactions. 3. Project Pipeline

This section outlines a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for credit card fraud detection:

Data Acquisition

Utilize a publicly available credit card transaction dataset (e.g., UCI Credit Card Fraud Dataset). Alternatively, collaborate with a financial institution to obtain real-world data (preferred for more realistic representation of fraudulent activities).

Data Preprocessing

This step ensures data quality and prepares it for modeling:

Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Techniques like imputation or outlier removal might be necessary. Normalization/Scaling: If necessary, normalize or scale features to a similar scale for improved model performance. Exploration/Visualization: Understand data distribution and relationships between features through exploration (e.g., histograms, boxplots) and visualization techniques. Feature Engineering: Create new features that might enhance model performance (e.g., average transaction amount per merchant).

Class Imbalance Analysis

Analyze the class distribution (fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions). If a significant imbalance exists, address it using techniques like: Oversampling: Replicate data points from the minority class (fraudulent) to increase its representation. Undersampling: Remove data points from the majority class (legitimate) to match the minority class size (use cautiously to avoid losing valuable data). SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique): Generate synthetic data points for the minority class.

Model Selection and Building

Evaluate various classification models commonly used for fraud detection: Logistic Regression: Linear model suitable for binary classification, efficient to train, and interpretable. However, it may struggle with complex, non-linear relationships.

Random Forest: Ensemble method combining predictions from multiple decision trees, leading to improved accuracy and robustness to overfitting. It can handle non-linear relationships but can be less interpretable than Logistic Regression.

XGBoost: Powerful gradient boosting algorithm known for its effectiveness. XGBoost uses decision trees as base learners and leverages a gradient boosting framework to achieve high accuracy and handle complex data structures. Offers flexibility in hyperparameter tuning.

Split the preprocessed data into training, validation, and testing sets:

Training set: Used to train the model.

Validation set: Used for hyperparameter tuning, preventing overfitting to the training data.

Testing set: Used for final evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data. Common splitting ratios: 70/15/15 (70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing) or 80/10/10. Train each model on the training set, optimizing hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV on the validation set.
